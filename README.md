# Nereus
> Nereus is a program designed to model trends as incompressible fluid flow. It uses a neural network to analyse the likely effect of a new trend based on the fact that there is a limited amount of liquid in the system. This model is useful across many industries, and the properties of liquid enable for the prediction of new trends since it is analogous to internet traffic.
